## TO Myself
- [ ] Review Recycle
- [ ] Integrate DB using Strapi (Probably today or maybe tomorrow since today we have to do requirement)

## Challenge
- [ ] Two or more accounts management. (might limit to five bc I dunno ;) )
- [ ] Using session or something like cookie to check that if user still in login state when they open this app it should appear in all post page.
- [ ] Try build app from Strapi that can record image on db. (Try with local first)

## Idea
- Record text and image
- Can use with multiple account
- Have option to show all post from every account (might've to do something like getAll() )
- Request sent with token on local to backend for checking authorize
